## WHY do we use Graphcms?

#### :fast_forward: Easy to setup Database
Headless CMS like "graphcms.com" provides a fully functional set up in just a few steps with graphql native.:ok_hand:

#### :baby: Easy to use
Graphcms provides a lot of tutorials at "https://graphcms.com/docs" to get started. Code examples for specific use cases are also available under "https://graphcms.com/docs/develop/code-examples".

#### :people_holding_hands: Teamwork is more efficientÂ 
Because the server is always online, all team members can easily update and synchronize the data, keeping the database up to date.

#### :muscle: Create Schema easily with Powerful Editors
Graphcms supports a variety of utilities to quickly and explicitly create a schema.  In particular, the GUI allows to simple drag and drop the models.

#### :handshake: Support creating Mutation and Query
When creating a Model in Schema, Graphcms automatically provides basic CRUD functionality throught an API. This saves us a lot of time and boiler plate code. In addition, Graphcms has an interface called "API Playground" to interact with the scheme live or compose complex GraphQL queries.

#### :lock: Security
Setting up access security, team settings, roles and permissions on Graphcms is also extremely simple.

## Setup 

1. Sign up at [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) and create a project there.

2. Define a schema with three types `Post`, `Person` and `Voter`.

3. Get your `GRAPH_CMS_ENDPOINT` and optionally create a `GRAPH_CMS_API_TOKEN` in Settings. And save in `.env`.

4. Store also a JWT secret in `.env`.

## Run

Before running test you need to create a file .env in backend root with the JWT secret, e.g. JWT_SECRET=jsonwebtoken

``` bash
# setup
yarn install

# lint
yarn lint

# run test
yarn test

# start server at localhost:4000
yarn start

```
